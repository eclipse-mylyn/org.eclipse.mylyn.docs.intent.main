h1. Intent : launch configurations

In this folder, you will find all the launch configurations used in the project.


h2. CDO

* LaunchCDOServer : Allow you to launch a CDOServer in tpc mode with an h2 database. 
The database can be accessed in your Eclipse folder (folder @/database]).

h2. Clients

Allow you to launch Intent Models Clients.

* Intent_workspaceClient1 : launches an Intent Client in Workspace Mode

h2. Tests 

Contains the launch configurations for all tests : 
* Parser-All-TestSuite : tests the modeling unit parser (Xtext), the Markup langage parser (WikiText) and the general parser
* Parser- Disabled TestSuite : tests that identify known issues and hence are not successful
* MarkupModel-All-TestSuite : a subSet of Parser-All-TestSuite that regroup all tests relative to the Markup langage parser
* Collab IDE-All-TestSuite : tests for the Repository using the Eclipse Workspace
* Collab IDE- Disabled TestSuite :tests that identify known issues and hence are not successful
* UI-TestSuite : tests relative to Intent UI (editor manipulation, Intent project creation...)


h2. Xtext

* GenerateModelingUnitParser : 
Generates the Modeling Unit Parser's code from the Xtext grammar (org.eclipse.mylyn.docs.intent.parser.modelingunit.Modelingunit.xtext).
This generation causes an Exception fileNotFound ('..\org.eclipse.mylyn.docs.intent.parser.ui\META-INF\MANIFEST.MF').
It's totally normal, as we have no UI project for our grammar.
