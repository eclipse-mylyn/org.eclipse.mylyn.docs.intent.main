Section Differencing the left model from right model when comparaison fails {
	During the Match process, deleted or added elements are considered as unmatched.

	Two different situations can occur : 

	* an element defined in the left model is not matching any element in the right model (deleted element)
	* an element defined in the right model is not matching any element in the left model (added element)

	If the feature @side@ of an UnmatchElement is _Right_, then it must be considered as an added element. 
	Otherwise, it is a deleted element.

	The MatchModel store suchs an element using @UnmatchElement@s (
	@see "TheUnmatchElementConcept" ). To differenciate
	added element from deleted element, we define the @EEnum@ *Side* :
